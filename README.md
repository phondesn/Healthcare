# MedFit-Assistant-App

## Description
I made a web-based application to help with health care that allows users to view information about their health. I used MySQL as the database and Java with Spring Boot for the backend when building the application.Â Reactjs was used to create the whole front end. The pictures below illustrate the user's reports on their health in many areas.

## Features 
The Application opens with the login screen.
